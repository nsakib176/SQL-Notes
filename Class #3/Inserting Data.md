The `INSERT` statement in SQL is used to add new rows of data into an existing table. It allows you to specify the values to be inserted into each column of the table. Here's the basic syntax for the `INSERT` statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

Let's go through some examples of the `INSERT` statement to illustrate how it works:

1. **Inserting Data into a Table with Explicit Column Names:**

   In this example, we're inserting data into a table named "Students" with specified column names:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Students (student_id, first_name, last_name, age)
   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 20);
   ```

   This statement inserts a new row into the "Students" table with the values provided for each specified column.

2. **Inserting Data into a Table with All Columns:**

   If you want to insert data into all columns, you don't need to specify the column names:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Employees
   VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'Johnson', 'Marketing');
   ```

   This statement inserts a new row into the "Employees" table. The values are provided in the order of the table's columns.

3. **Inserting Multiple Rows at Once:**

   You can insert multiple rows in a single `INSERT` statement by providing a set of values for each row:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date)
   VALUES
       (1, 101, '2023-10-15'),
       (2, 102, '2023-10-16'),
       (3, 103, '2023-10-17');
   ```

   This inserts three rows into the "Orders" table with the specified values for each row.

4. **Inserting Data into a Table with Subquery:**

   You can also insert data into a table using a subquery. For example, to copy data from one table to another:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO NewTable (column1, column2, column3)
   SELECT columnA, columnB, columnC
   FROM OldTable
   WHERE condition;
   ```

   This inserts data into `NewTable` based on the results of the subquery.

Remember that when using the `INSERT` statement, the data types and the order of values must match the corresponding columns in the table. Additionally, ensure that any constraints on the table (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE) are satisfied to maintain data integrity.
